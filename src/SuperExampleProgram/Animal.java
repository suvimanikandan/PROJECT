//We can use super keyword to access the data member or field of parent class.
// It is used if parent class and child class have same fields.
public class Animal {

    String color="black";

//In the above example, Animal and Dog both classes have a common property color.
// If we print color property, it will print the color of current class by default.
// To access the parent property, we need to use super keyword.
